      <p>
        Before I ever touched a line of professional code, I was solving
        problemsâ€”real ones. Working odd jobs to support my family, I found
        myself automating spreadsheets, organizing workflows, and optimizing
        everyday tasks with Excel. That hunger to solve things better is what
        led me to programming. Through online courses on Codecademy, Alison, and
        YouTube, I discovered a world where creativity and logic intersected. I
        taught myself Python for data analysis, dove into JavaScript, and built
        tools to make lifeâ€”and workâ€”more efficient. I didnâ€™t come from a
        traditional CS background, but I learned how to teach myself, how to
        troubleshoot, and how to keep going when the docs didnâ€™t make sense at 2
        AM. My early tech roles werenâ€™t glamorous, but they taught me how to
        think. From customer service to quality assurance, I learned how to
        really listen, how to explain complex things clearly, and how to build
        systems that support people. I studied network security, SEO, and
        project managementâ€”not for a certificate on the wall, but because each
        piece helped me sharpen my skills. Today, Iâ€™m a full-stack developer and
        technical problem solver. But more than that, Iâ€™m someone whoâ€™s built
        this career with purpose. I believe that great software starts with
        empathy, that clarity beats cleverness, and that learning never stops.
